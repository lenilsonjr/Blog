Today is a big day. I'm officially making the leap and quitting my daytime job to go **back** to freelancing and full time [shipping](https://wip.chat/@lenilsonjr).

Yes, after 10 months on the job, I'm leaving.

I have some clients from a past life, recurring revenue from some contracts, an online product with some paying customers and savings for 6 months of no cashflow. That's it.

These past months have been fun. I mean, really. The team I worked with is absolutely amazing, but I coudn't fit in a culture that requires on-site presence and 9-5 work in the office.

Before taking this job I was already freelancing for like a year. Things were going great, but my fear and anxiety that I would suck at life for quitting school, not getting a "real" job and not having enough money made me pursue a salaried job.

I don't regret it, this was important to show what paths I do **not** want to take. Nothing is worth more than my freedom. No salary in the world (well, that's a pretty bullshit statement to make) is worth my freedom of choice, and by choice I mean who I'm gonna work with, where I'm gonna work from and how much time I wanna work.

Working 9-5 with a junior salary and living in a expensive city means that I usually spend some hours a day in traffic, usually eat a lot of crap, save almost no money, and the worst: have to rely mostly on a single source of income.

Companies say they want "entrepreneurial" people, but not actual entrepreneurs.

I'm well aware of the downsides of the other life, don't get me wrong. I have no kids, no wife, no debt, I'm still very young, and if everything goes nuts I still have my parent's home, etc, etc, etc.

This is the time to take big risks, because the downsides are very small and the upsides can be pretty big.

Main issue, of course, is to keep my rent and my bills (and food, of course) in check. The other challenge is to make sure I keep saving some money and investing 40%~60% of my time on products with recurring revenue.

It's definetly not going to be easy, and the chance of success is small, as usual. But as I said, it is a unique moment to take more risk.

I have a shot, and that's enough.
