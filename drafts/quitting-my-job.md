Today is a big day. I'm officially making the leap and quitting my daytime job to go **back** to freelancing and full time [shipping](https://wip.chat/@lenilsonjr).

Yes, after 10 months on the job, I'm leaving.

I have some clients from a past life, recurring revenue from some contracts, an online product with some paying customers and savings for 6 months of no cash flow. That's it.

To understand this decision you'll need a bit of empathy, and also some knowledge about the I.T. environment in Brazil.

These past months have been fun. I mean, really. The team I worked with is absolutely amazing, but I couldn't fit in a culture that requires on-site presence and 9-5 work in the office.

Before taking this job I was already freelancing for like a year. Things were going great, but my fear and anxiety that I would suck at life for quitting school, not getting a "real" job and not having enough money made me pursue a salaried job. Guess what, this game is also rigged.

I don't regret it, this was important to show what paths I do **not** want to take. 

Working 9-5 with a junior salary and living in a expensive city means that I usually spend some hours a day in traffic, usually eat a lot of crap, save almost no money, and the worst: have to rely mostly on a single source of income.

For instance, a junior developer makes something between R$24.000 ($7.380) and R$42.000 ($12.910) a year where I live (Brazil's northeast). This is, of course, far away from SF's big paychecks with lots of benefits. And guess what, the hours are just as long.

So, the way I see, I'm not really taking any big risk here. I'm just trading a poor lifestyle for another poor lifestyle, but at least as a freelancer and maker I have more room to grow.

I'm well aware of the downsides of the other life, don't get me wrong. I have no kids, no wife, no debt, I'm still very young, and if everything goes nuts I still have my parent's home, etc, etc, etc.

This is the time to take a risk, because the downsides are very small and the upsides can be pretty big.

Main issue, of course, is to keep my rent and bills (and food, of course) in check. The other challenge is to make sure I keep saving some money and investing 40%~60% of my time on products that can be resold.

It's definitely not going to be easy, and the chance of success is small, as usual. But as I said, it is a unique moment to take more risk. I have very little to lose besides a gap in my CV.

I have no fucking clue if I'm suitable or not to be an entrepreneur. Last time I decided to play the CEO I almost broke down, but nothing compares to what I have been feeling these last few weeks. Two panic attacks, my health is shit, almost no time to dedicate to myself, my body, and my projects. And there's the commute, oh, the commute.

If I want to succeed in this office life I gotta do a lot of stuff that doesn't match my values and goals in life. That includes shutting myself up, always ask for mercy to receive a raise, play the political game, and of course I have to be content with the fact that I'm only gonna have 30 days a year to relax and dedicate to myself.

I look around and see peers wasting their relationships, marriages and health because of companies that, in the end, are just money making machines for someone else. I see peers who built a "success" that I definitely don't want to myself.

Don't get me wrong. I know there's a lot entrepreneurs in fucked up situations too. But at least I have more room to move if I don't have to rely on a single institution to pay my bills.
Both paths are full of pain and illusions, the ultimate question is what path I'm most suitable for, according to me and my environment, and for now the answer is very clear.

Of course, I could find a company where I have healthy work schedules, time for side projects, remote friendly, great benefits and a reasonable paycheck. But that's just as hard as building a business.
First of all, there's VERY few companies with this mindset in Brazil, and my english and work experience is far from perfect to find a job overseas.

So, I'm taking the harsh path.

I have a shot, and that's enough.
