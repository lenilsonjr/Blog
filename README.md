# My Blog
All of my markdown blog entries. Using [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org).

I usually use [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writting.

You can also read my posts at [lenilson.blog](https://lenilson.blog).

You don't really need to clone this unless you want to do a data analysis on me.
