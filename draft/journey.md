*This is normally a post I would write in a very inspirational (and aspirational) day (and probably keep only on my journal), but these thoughts have been on my mind for some time so I feel it's time for them to see the light.*

I learned to code at the age of 10. At 12 I got my first customers as a freelancer and bought my first laptop (which is the one I still use today). At the age of 14 I joined a high-end school in my country. At the age of 15 I dropped out school. At 16 I landed on a job as a software developer.

And here I'm, 17 years old, and fucking terrified about the future.

Terrified about writing this article.
Terrified about what other people think about me.
Terrified if I'm making enough money.
Terrified if all of this is a hoax.
Terrified about living.

From a objectival pespective, I'm fine. But it's always the thoughts about the future that scares me the most.

What if I'm deadly wrong about the value of college (and high school) education?
What if tech is just a bubble?
What if I can't compete in this world?

Lots of stuff, I know.

I don't know yet how to supress my anxiety. Maybe it is by getting the things I want, or maybe I need to supress it before going chasing the things I want.

My goals stay the same. Online product, location independent and working for myself.

This is simply the greatest time to be alive, and I can take all the risks in the world without harsh consequences simply because I'm young.

It's bullshit to spend my time inside an office working for someone else money-making machine. That's all I know.

It's time to take a risk, again.
